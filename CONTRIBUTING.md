## Coding Conventions

### Formatting

Code formatting is enforced using the [Spotless](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless) Gradle plugin. You can use `gradle spotlessApply` to format new code and add missing license headers to source files. Formatter settings for Eclipse are available [in the repository](src/eclipse/junit-lambda-eclipse-formatter-settings.xml). For IntelliJ IDEA there's a [plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/6546) you can use.

### Tests

#### Naming

- All test classes must end with a `Tests` suffix.
- Example test classes that should not be picked up by the build must end with a `TestCase` suffix.

#### Assertions

- Use `org.junit.gen5.api.Assertions` wherever possible.
- Use AssertJ when richer assertions are needed.
- Do not use `org.junit.Assert` or `junit.framework.Assert`.

#### Mocking

- Use either Mockito or hand-written test doubles.
