===== Deprecations and Breaking Changes

* Revert change introduced in RC1: test classes written in the Kotlin programming
  language are now executed with the same default test instance lifecycle mode as Java
  classes again (i.e., "per-method").
* The `junit.conditions.deactivate` configuration parameter has been renamed to
  `junit.jupiter.conditions.deactivate`.
* The `junit.extensions.autodetection.enabled` configuration parameter has been renamed
  to `junit.jupiter.extensions.autodetection.enabled`.

  Use the explicit call `getStore(Namespace.GLOBAL)` instead.
