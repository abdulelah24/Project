=== JUnit Platform

==== New Features and Improvements

* New `ClassSource.from(URI)` static factory method for creating a `ClassSource` from a
  URI using the `class` scheme and optional query parameters specifying the line number
  and column number. This is analogous to the existing `ClasspathResourceSource.from(URI)`
  factory method.
* New `getConfigurationParameters()` method in the `TestPlan` which allows a
  `TestExecutionListener` to access
  <<../user-guide/index.adoc#running-tests-config-params, configuration parameters>>. See
  <<../user-guide/index.adoc#launcher-api-listeners-config, Configuring an Execution
  Listener>> for details.
* New `UniqueIdTrackingListener` which is a `TestExecutionListener` that tracks the unique
  IDs of all tests that were executed during the `TestPlan` and generates a file
  containing the unique IDs. The generated file can be used to rerun those tests -- for
  example, in order to run the same set of tests executed on the JVM subsequently within a
  GraalVM native image. See the Javadoc for `{UniqueIdTrackingListener}` for details.
* Generating Java Flight Recorder events via module `org.junit.platform.jfr` is now also
  supported on Java 8 Update 262 or higher, in addition to Java 11 or later. See
  <<../user-guide/index.adoc#running-tests, Flight Recorder Support>> for details.

[[release-notes-5.8.0-M2-junit-jupiter]]
=== JUnit Jupiter

==== Bug Fixes

* The `IndicativeSentences` `DisplayNameGenerator` no longer includes the display name of
  the enclosing class when generating an _indicative sentence_ if the enclosing class is
  not configured to use the `IndicativeSentences` display name generator as well.

==== Deprecations and Breaking Changes

* ❓

==== New Features and Improvements

* `@TempDir` now supports creating multiple temporary directories via an identifier
  specified on the annotation (e.g. `@TempDir("a")` and `@TempDir("b")`).
* New `named()` static factory method in the `Named` interface that serves as an _alias_
  for `Named.of()`. `named()` is intended to be used via `import static`.
* New `class` URI scheme for dynamic test sources. This allows tests to be located using
  the information available in a `StackTraceElement`.
* `@TempDir` cleanup resets readable and executable permissions of the root temporary
  directory and any contained directories instead of failing to delete them.
