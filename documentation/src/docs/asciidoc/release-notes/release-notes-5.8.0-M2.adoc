=== JUnit Platform

==== Bug Fixes

==== Deprecations and Breaking Changes

* ❓

==== New Features and Improvements

* New `getConfigurationParameters()` method in the `TestPlan` which allows a
  `TestExecutionListener` to access
  <<../user-guide/index.adoc#running-tests-config-params, configuration parameters>>. See
  <<../user-guide/index.adoc#launcher-api-listeners-config, Configuring an Execution
  Listener>> for details.
* New `UniqueIdTrackingListener` which is a `TestExecutionListener` that tracks the unique
  IDs of all tests that were executed during the `TestPlan` and generates a file
  containing the unique IDs. The generated file can be used to rerun those tests -- for
  example, in order to run the same set of tests executed on the JVM subsequently within a
  GraalVM native image. See the Javadoc for `{UniqueIdTrackingListener}` for details.

  _alias_ for `Named.of()`. `named()` is intended to be used via `import static`.
