==== Deprecations and Breaking Changes

* `@EnabledIf`/`@DisabledIf` are removed from Jupiter's API.
  Script-based condition APIs and their supporting implementations were deprecated with
  the intent to remove them in JUnit Jupiter 5.5. Users must now rely on a combination of
  other built-in conditions or create and use a custom implementation of
  `ExecutionCondition` to evaluate the same conditions.
