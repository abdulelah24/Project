[[release-notes-5.6.0-M1-junit-platform]]
=== JUnit Platform

==== Bug Fixes

* Module `org.junit.platform.launcher` now reads `java.logging` due to usage of types in
  package `java.util.logging`.

==== Deprecations and Breaking Changes

* In the `EngineTestKit` API, the `all()`, `containers()`, and `tests()` methods in
  `EngineExecutionResults` have been deprecated in favor of the new `allEvents()`,
  `containerEvents()`, and `testEvents()` methods, respectively. The deprecated methods
  will be removed in JUnit Platform 1.7.0.

==== New Features and Improvements

* New `printFailuresTo(PrintWriter, int)` method in `TestExecutionSummary` that allows one
  to specify the maximum number of lines to print for exception stack traces.
* The `junit-platform-commons` module no longer has a dependency on the `java.compiler`
  module (in terms of the Java Module System). Specifically, a new internal utility has
  been introduced in `PackageUtils` that implements functionality equivalent to
  `javax.lang.model.SourceVersion.isName(CharSequence)` from the `java.compiler` module.
* Exceptions thrown by test engines during discovery and execution are now reported to
  `TestExecutionListeners`.
* Module `org.junit.platform.console` now provides a `java.util.spi.ToolProvider`
  implementation that can be acquired by `ToolProvider.findFirst("junit")` when running
  on Java 9 or above.
* New methods in `DiscoverySelectors` to select and execute individual tests in
  inherited nested classes, via specific selectors (`NestedClassSelector` and
  `NestedMethodSelector`).


[[release-notes-5.6.0-M1-junit-jupiter]]
=== JUnit Jupiter

==== Bug Fixes

* ❓

==== Deprecations and Breaking Changes

* `@EnabledIf` and `@DisabledIf` have been removed from Jupiter's API. Script-based
  condition APIs and their supporting implementations were deprecated in JUnit Jupiter 5.5
  with the intent to remove them in JUnit Jupiter 5.6. Users must now rely on a
  combination of other built-in conditions or create and use a custom implementation of
  `ExecutionCondition` to evaluate the same conditions.

==== New Features and Improvements

* Support for multi-character delimiters in `@CsvSource` and `@CsvFileSource`.
* Support for custom `null` values in `@CsvSource` and `@CsvFileSource`.
* Documented support for comments in CSV files loaded via `@CsvFileSource`.
* Auto-detection of enum type from method signature for `@EnumSource`.
* New `TypeBasedParameterResolver<T>` abstract base class that serves as a generic adapter
  for the `ParameterResolver` API and simplifies the implementation of a custom resolver
  that supports parameters of a specific type.
* New configuration parameter `junit.jupiter.execution.timeout.mode` to control whether
  timeouts are applied to tests or not. Supported values are: `enabled`, `disabled`, and
  `disabled_on_debug`.
* New `@EnabledForJreRange` and `@DisabledForJreRange` annotations for easier test execution
  handling on multiple versions of JRE.
* Extension providing `@TempDir` path tries to delete non-writable files by make them
  writable first.
* New `TestInstancePreDestroyCallback` interface that defines the API for `Extension`'s
  that wish to process test instances *after* they have been used in tests and *before*
  they are destroyed.


[[release-notes-5.6.0-M1-junit-vintage]]
=== JUnit Vintage

==== Bug Fixes

* JUnit 3 suites with duplicate test names are now reported correctly.

==== Deprecations and Breaking Changes

* ❓

==== New Features and Improvements

* Improve performance for projects with a large number of tests.
* Improve performance for test classes with a large number of methods.
