[[release-notes-5.2.0-M1-overall-improvements]]
=== Overall Improvements

* JUnit BOM: To ease dependency management using
https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-dependency-mechanism.html#Importing_Dependencies[Maven]
or https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/managing_transitive_dependencies.html#sec:bom_import[Gradle],
a Bill of Materials POM is now provided under the `org.junit:junit-bom:5.2.0-M1` Maven
coordinates.

=== JUnit Platform

==== Bug Fixes

* Tag expressions containing spaces are now supported in the JUnit Platform Maven
  Surefire provider.

==== Deprecations and Breaking Changes

* ❓

==== New Features and Improvements

* The default _include pattern_ for filtering class names now matches test classes whose
  names either start with `Test` or end with `Test` or `Tests`.
  - This pattern is used by the `ConsoleLauncher`, the JUnit Platform Gradle Plugin, and
    the `JUnitPlatform` runner.


[[release-notes-5.2.0-M1-junit-jupiter]]
=== JUnit Jupiter

==== Bug Fixes

* ❓

==== Deprecations and Breaking Changes

* ❓

==== New Features and Improvements

* New `assertDoesNotThrow()` methods in `Assertions` which assert that the execution of
  a given code block does _not_ throw any kind of exception.
* New `fail()` method in `Assertions` makes it possible to fail a test without an
  explicit failure message.
* Implicit support for _widening primitive conversion_ for an argument supplied to a
  `@ParameterizedTest`.
  - For example, a parameterized test annotated with `@ValueSource(ints = { 1, 2, 3 })`
    can be declared to accept an argument of type `int`, `long`, `float`, or `double`.
* `@MethodSource` now supports `static` factory methods declared in external classes
  referenced by _fully qualified method name_.
* Support for aggregation of multiple `@ParameterizedTest` arguments into a single object.
  - For details, see
    <<../user-guide/index.adoc#writing-tests-parameterized-tests-argument-aggregation,
    Argument Aggregation>>.
