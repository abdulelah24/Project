[[release-notes-5.10.0-RC1-junit-platform]]
=== JUnit Platform

==== Bug Fixes

* ❓

==== Deprecations and Breaking Changes

* The `getMethodParameterTypes()` methods in `MethodSelector` and `NestedMethodSelector`
  have been deprecated and replaced by `getParameterTypeNames()` for greater clarity.
* Methods in `DiscoverySelectors` that accept a `ClassLoader` now declare the
  `ClassLoader` as the first parameter. This is only a breaking change for code that
  relies on the new methods introduced in JUnit Platform 1.10 M1.

==== New Features and Improvements

* New `@SelectMethod` selector support in the `@Suite` test engine.
* New `selectMethod()` and `selectNestedMethod()` variants in `DiscoverySelectors` that
  accept a `Class<?>...` argument of parameter types as a type-safe alternative to
  providing the names of parameter types as a comma-delimited string.
* Allow selecting classes by name via new the `names` attribute in `@SelectClasses`.
