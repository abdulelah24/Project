[[release-notes-5.4.0-RC1-overall-improvements]]
=== Overall Improvements

* A regression introduced in version 5.4.0-M1 of the `junit-bom` has been fixed:
  `<scope/>` elements are omitted from the `<dependency/>` elements again.


[[release-notes-5.4.0-RC1-junit-platform]]
=== JUnit Platform

==== Bug Fixes

* ❓

==== Deprecations and Breaking Changes

* `TestPlan.add(TestIdentifier)` has always been considered _internal_ and is now
  appropriately annotated with `@API(status = INTERNAL)`. All attempts to call it from
  third-party code will now be ignored. IDEs and build tools should remove any code that
  calls the method.

==== New Features and Improvements

* The `Launcher` API now provides an `execute(TestPlan, TestExecutionListener...)`
  method that allows one to execute a previously discovered `TestPlan`.
* `@RunWith(JUnitPlatform.class)` no longer executes test discovery twice.


[[release-notes-5.4.0-RC1-junit-jupiter]]
=== JUnit Jupiter

==== Bug Fixes

* `@RegisterExtension` fields that are `null` when evaluated are no longer silently
  ignored. Instead, the corresponding test class or test method now fails with an
  informative exception.
* `@ParameterizedTest` now again supports `MessageFormat` patterns for individual
  parameters (e.g. `{0,number,#.##}`).

==== Deprecations and Breaking Changes

* ❓

==== New Features and Improvements

* Extensions registered _programmatically_ via `@RegisterExtension` may now be registered
  in an explicit order via the `@Order` annotation.
  - See <<../user-guide/index.adoc#extensions-registration-programmatic-order, Extension
    Registration Order>> in the User Guide for details.
* New `@NullSource`, `@EmptySource`, and `@NullAndEmptySource` argument sources that
  provide `null` and _empty_ arguments to `@ParameterizedTest` methods.
  - See <<../user-guide/index.adoc#writing-tests-parameterized-tests-sources-null-and-empty,
    Null and Empty Sources>> in the User Guide for details.
* New `TestWatcher` extension API that allows extensions to process test results by
  defining result-based callbacks invoked after text execution.
  - See <<../user-guide/index.adoc#extensions-test-result-processing, Test Result
    Processing>> in the User Guide for details.
* `TempDirectory` extension now also accepts to inject a parameter of type `File`.
  - See <<../user-guide/index.adoc#writing-tests-built-in-extensions-TempDirectory,
  The TempDirectory Extension>> in the User Guide for details.

[[release-notes-5.4.0-RC1-junit-vintage]]
=== JUnit Vintage

==== Bug Fixes

* The `VintageTestEngine` now uses the fully qualified class name as the _legacy reporting
  name_ for Vintage test classes instead of the simple class name which caused problems in
  test reports based on legacy reporting names -- for example, reports generated by Maven
  Surefire.
