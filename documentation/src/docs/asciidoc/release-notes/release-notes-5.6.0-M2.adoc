[[release-notes-5.6.0-M2-overall-improvements]]
=== Overall Improvements

* OSGi metadata is now published in all binary JARs.


[[release-notes-5.6.0-M2️-junit-platform]]
=== JUnit Platform

==== Bug Fixes

* The `EventConditions.nestedContainer()` method in the Engine Test Kit now correctly
  handles events from multiple levels of nested classes.

==== Deprecations and Breaking Changes

* ❓

==== New Features and Improvements

* `TestExecutionSummary.Failure` is now serializable.
* `ReflectionSupport.findNestedClasses(...)` now detects cycles within inner class
  hierarchies. Consult the Javadoc for details.
* `ThrowableCollector.toTestExecutionResult()` is now public.


[[release-notes-5.6.0-M2️-junit-jupiter]]
=== JUnit Jupiter

==== Bug Fixes

* When `@Nested` is used, the temporary directory is now also injected into instance
  fields of enclosing classes annotated with `@TempDir`.

==== Deprecations and Breaking Changes

* ❓

==== New Features and Improvements

* `@EnabledIfEnvironmentVariable`, `@DisabledIfEnvironmentVariable`,
  `@EnabledIfSystemProperty`, and `@DisabledIfSystemProperty` may now be used as
  _repeatable_ annotations. In other words, it is now possible to declare each of those
  annotations multiple times on a test interface, test class, or test method.
* Discovery of `@Nested` test classes that form a cycle now results in an exception that
  halts execution of the JUnit Jupiter test engine instead of infinite recursion.
* Parameter names are now included in the default display name of a `@ParameterizedTest`
  invocation (if they are present in the bytecode). The `{argumentsWithNames}` pattern
  can also be used in custom names.
* New `TestInstancePreDestroyCallback` interface that defines the API for `Extension`
  that wish to process test instances *after* they have been used in tests and *before*
  they are destroyed.
* `InvocationInterceptor` extensions may now explicitly `skip()` an intercepted
  invocation. This allows executing it by other means, e.g. in a forked JVM.
* Adding supports for WildCardType and type hierarchy for `TypeBasedParameterResolver<T>`.
