==== New Features and Improvements

* Text blocks in `@CsvSource` are now treated as complete CSV files, including support for
  comments beginning with a `+++#+++` symbol as well as support for new lines within
  quoted strings. See the
  <<../user-guide/index.adoc#writing-tests-parameterized-tests-sources-CsvSource, User
  Guide>> for details and examples.
* The quote character for _quoted strings_ in `@CsvSource` is now configurable via the new
  `quoteCharacter` attribute, which defaults to a single quote (`'`) for backward
  compatibility.
