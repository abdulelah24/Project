[[release-notes-5.11.1-junit-platform]]
=== JUnit Platform

[[release-notes-5.11.1-junit-platform-bug-fixes]]
==== Bug Fixes

* Fixed potential locking issue with `ExclusiveResource` in the
  `HierarchicalTestExecutorService`, which could lead to deadlocks in certain scenarios.
* `NamespacedHierarchicalStore` no longer throws an exception after it has been closed if
  the store is queried via one of the `get(...)` or `getOrComputeIfAbsent(...)` methods;
  however, if a `getOrComputeIfAbsent(...)` invocation results in the computation of a new
  value, an exception will still be thrown.
