[[release-notes-5.4.0-M1-junit-platform]]
=== JUnit Platform

==== Bug Fixes

* ❓

==== Deprecations and Breaking Changes

* The JUnit Platform Surefire Provider (`junit-platform-surefire-provider`) has been
  discontinued and is no longer released as part of JUnit 5. Please use Maven Surefire’s
  native support for running tests on the JUnit Platform instead (requires Maven Surefire
  2.22.0 or higher).

==== New Features and Improvements

* New `junit-platform-reporting` artifact containing the `XmlReportsWritingListener` that
  generates a XML report in format compatible with the de facto standard for JUnit 4
  based test reports that was made popular by the Ant build system.
* New `ModifierSupport` class providing an API for extension and test engine authors to
  inspect modifiers of classes and members.
  - See the <<../user-guide/index.adoc#extensions-supported-utilities-modifier, User
    Guide>> for details.
* Exceptions reported due to failed reflective operations such as loading a class, reading
  a field's value, or looking up a method by name now include the original exception as
  their cause to make it easier to debug underlying issues.


[[release-notes-5.4.0-M1-junit-jupiter]]
=== JUnit Jupiter

==== Bug Fixes

* ❓

==== Deprecations and Breaking Changes

* ❓

==== New Features and Improvements

* `Assertions.assertEquals()` variants that compare floating point numbers using a delta
  now support a _delta_ of zero.
* New `Assertions.assertEquals()` variants that accept mixed boxed and unboxed primitive
  values, allowing statements such as `assertEquals(42, Integer.valueOf("42"))` to
  compile.
* New `Assertions.assertNotEquals()` variants that accept the following primitive data
  types: `char`, `byte`, `short`, `int`, `long`, `float`, and `double`. Mixed boxed and
  unboxed primitive values are also supported.
* Exceptions thrown in `Assertions.assertAll()` are now additionally tracked as
  _suppressed exceptions_ in the resulting `MultipleFailuresError`. Consequently, the
  stack traces for such exceptions are now visible as _Suppressed_ at the end of the
  stack trace for the invocation of `assertAll()`.
* JUnit 4's `AssumptionViolatedException` is now supported in JUnit Jupiter for aborting
  a test mid-flight due to a failed assumption -- for example, via JUnit 4's
  `org.junit.Assume` utility class.
* New `JRE.JAVA_12` enum constant for use with `@EnabledOnJre` and `@DisabledOnJre`.
* In addition to returning streams, `@TestFactory`-annotated methods may now return a
  single `DynamicNode` -- for example, a `DynamicTest` or a `DynamicContainer`.
* Implicit conversion from hexadecimal and octal string representations to integral types
  in `@ParameterizedTest` arguments -- for example, conversion from `"0xff"` to `255`.
* New `LOCALE` and `TIME_ZONE` constants in `org.junit.jupiter.api.parallel.Resources`
  for use with `@ResourceLock` to synchronize test execution regarding the default
  `Locale` and default `TimeZone`, respectively.
* New `MethodOrderer` API for ordering the sequence of tests with built-in support for
  _alphanumeric_, `@Order` annotation based, and _random_ ordering of test methods.
  - See <<../user-guide/index.adoc#writing-tests-test-execution-order, Test Execution
    Order>> in the User Guide for details.
* New `DisplayNameGenerator` interface and `@DisplayNameGeneration` annotation that allow
  declarative configuration of a pre-defined or custom display name generator.
* JUnit 4's `@Ignore` annotation is now supported for disabling test classes and test
  methods via the `junit-jupiter-migrationsupport` module.
  - See the <<../user-guide/index.adoc#migrating-from-junit4-ignore-annotation-support,
    User Guide>> for details.
