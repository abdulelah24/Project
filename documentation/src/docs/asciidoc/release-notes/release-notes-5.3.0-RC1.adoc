* New `TestInstanceFactory` extension API that enables custom creation of test class
  instances.
  - See <<../user-guide/index.adoc#extensions-test-instance-factories, Test Instance
    Factories>> in the User Guide for details.
* `ArgumentConverters` and `ArgumentsAggregators` registered using `@ConvertWith` and
  `@AggregateWith`, respectively, are now only instantiated once per `@ParameterizedTest`
  instead of once for each invocation.
* Performance improvements for executing parameterized tests, particularly when the method
  declares more than a few parameters.

==== Deprecations and Breaking Changes

==== New Features and Improvements

* The `VintageTestEngine` now uses the _simple name_ of a test class as the display
  name instead of the _fully qualified class name_. This aligns with the behavior of the
  `JupiterTestEngine`.
