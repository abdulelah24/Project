[[release-notes-5.5.0-M2-junit-platform]]
=== JUnit Platform

==== Bug Fixes

* ❓

==== Deprecations and Breaking Changes

* Class `PreconditionViolationException` in concealed package
 `org.junit.platform.commons.util` is now deprecated and substituted by an exception class
  with the same name in exported package `org.junit.platform.commons`.

==== New Features and Improvements

* `AnnotationSupport.findRepeatableAnnotations()` now finds repeatable annotations used as
  meta-annotations on other repeatable annotations.
* New `AnnotationSupport.findRepeatableAnnotations()` variant that accepts a
  `java.util.Optional<? extends AnnotatedElement>` argument.
* Exceptions thrown by `TestExecutionListeners` no longer cause test execution to abort.
  Instead, they will be logged as warnings now.


[[release-notes-5.5.0-M2-junit-jupiter]]
=== JUnit Jupiter

==== Bug Fixes

* Execution of dynamic tests registered via a `@TestFactory` method no longer results in
  an `OutOfMemoryError` if the executables in the dynamic tests retain references to
  objects consuming large amounts of memory. Technically speaking, JUnit Jupiter no longer
  retains references to instances of `DynamicTest` after they have been executed.

==== Deprecations and Breaking Changes

* ❓

==== New Features and Improvements

* New overloaded variants of `Assertions.assertLinesMatch(...)` that accept a `String` or
  a `Supplier<String>` for a custom failure message.
* Failure messages for `Assertions.assertLinesMatch(...)` now emit each expected and
  actual line in a dedicated line.
* New Kotlin friendly `assertDoesNotThrow` assertions have been added as top-level
  functions in the `org.junit.jupiter.api` package.
* Display names for test methods generated by the `ReplaceUnderscores`
  `DisplayNameGenerator` no longer include empty parentheses for test methods that do not
  declare any parameters.
* `MethodOrderer.Random` now generates a default random seed only once and prints it to
  the log in order to allow reproducible builds.
* Methods ordered with `MethodOrderer.Random` now execute using the `SAME_THREAD`
  concurrency mode instead of the `CONCURRENT` mode when no custom seed is provided.
* New `emptyValue` attribute in `@CsvFileSource` and `@CsvSource`.
* All methods in the `TestWatcher` API are now interface `default` methods with empty
  implementations.
* New `InvocationInterceptor` extension API (see
  <<../user-guide/index.adoc#extensions-intercepting-invocations, User Guide>> for
  details).
* New Kotlin friendly `assertDoesNotThrow` assertion added as top-level functions in the
  `org.junit.jupiter.api` package
* New `junit.jupiter.displayname.generator.default` configuration parameter to set the
  default `DisplayNameGenerator` that will be used unless `@DisplayName` or
  `@DisplayNameGeneration` are present.
