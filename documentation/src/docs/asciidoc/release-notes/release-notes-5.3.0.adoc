[[release-notes-5.3.0-junit-jupiter]]
=== JUnit Jupiter

==== Bug Fixes

* The `junit-jupiter-params` JAR file was missing the required Kotlin metadata for the
  `getAs<Class>(index)` Kotlin extension method. The underlying packaging issue has now
  been solved, and the extension method has been renamed to `get<Class>(index)` as
  originally intended in 5.3.0-M1.

==== Deprecations and Breaking Changes

* ❓

==== New Features and Improvements

* The dynamic test API has been promoted from _experimental_ to _maintained_ status. This
  affects the `@TestFactory` annotation as well as the `DynamicTest`, `DynamicContainer`,
  and `DynamicNode` types in the `org.junit.jupiter.api` package.
* Implicit argument conversion for parameterized tests can now convert strings like
  `java.lang.Integer` to `Class` instances.
