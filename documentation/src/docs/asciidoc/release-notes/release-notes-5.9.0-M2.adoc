==== Bug Fixes

* ❓

==== Deprecations and Breaking Changes

* ❓

==== New Features and Improvements

* Default `@MethodSource` factory methods can now accept arguments. A _default_ factory
  method is a method declared in the test class with the same name as the
  `@ParameterizedTest` method that is inferred as the factory method when no explicit
  factory method is specified in the `@MethodSource` annotation.

* Thread mode can be set on `@Timeout` annotation. It allows to configure whether the test code
  is executed in the thread of the calling code or in a separate thread, the modes are:
  `INFERRED` (default) which resolves the thread mode configured via the
  property `junit.jupiter.execution.timeout.thread.mode.default`, `SAME_THREAD` that executes
  the test code in the same thread than the calling code, and `SEPARATE_THREAD` which
  executes the test code in a separate thread.
