[[release-notes-5.6.0-RC1-overall-improvements]]
=== Overall Improvements

* OSGi metadata is now published in all binary JARs.


[[release-notes-5.6.0-RC1-junit-platform]]
=== JUnit Platform

==== Bug Fixes

* The `EventConditions.nestedContainer()` method in the Engine Test Kit now correctly
  handles events from multiple levels of nested classes.

==== Deprecations and Breaking Changes

* ❓

==== New Features and Improvements

* `TestExecutionSummary.Failure` is now serializable.
* Running all tests with any tags or without any tags at all is now supported
  by using the special expressions `any()` and `none()`.
* `ReflectionSupport.findNestedClasses(...)` now detects cycles within inner class
  hierarchies. Consult the Javadoc for details.
* `ThrowableCollector.toTestExecutionResult()` is now public.


[[release-notes-5.6.0-RC1-junit-jupiter]]
=== JUnit Jupiter

==== Bug Fixes

* When `@Nested` is used, the temporary directory is now also injected into instance
  fields of enclosing classes annotated with `@TempDir`.

==== Deprecations and Breaking Changes

* ❓

==== New Features and Improvements

* `@EnabledIfEnvironmentVariable`, `@DisabledIfEnvironmentVariable`,
  `@EnabledIfSystemProperty`, and `@DisabledIfSystemProperty` may now be used as
  _repeatable_ annotations. In other words, it is now possible to declare each of those
  annotations multiple times on a test interface, test class, or test method.
* Discovery of `@Nested` test classes that form a cycle now results in an exception that
  halts execution of the JUnit Jupiter test engine instead of infinite recursion.
* Parameter names are now included in the default display name of a `@ParameterizedTest`
  invocation (if they are present in the bytecode). The `{argumentsWithNames}` pattern
  can also be used in custom names.
* New `TestInstancePreDestroyCallback` interface that defines the API for `Extension`
  that wish to process test instances *after* they have been used in tests and *before*
  they are destroyed.
* `InvocationInterceptor` extensions may now explicitly `skip()` an intercepted
  invocation. This allows executing it by other means, e.g. in a forked JVM.
* `JAVA_15` has been added to the `JRE` enum for use with JRE-based execution conditions.


[[release-notes-5.6.0-RC1-junit-vintage]]
=== JUnit Vintage

==== Bug Fixes

* ❓

==== Deprecations and Breaking Changes

* ❓

==== New Features and Improvements

* To support adoption of the recent JUnit 4.13 release, the Vintage engine now requires
  the new version in its POM and Gradle Module Metadata. However, if you absolutely have
  to stay on 4.12, you can safely downgrade the dependency manually because the Vintage
  engine will remain compatible with 4.12.
