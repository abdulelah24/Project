== Extension Model


=== Overview

In contrast to the competing `Runner`, `@Rule`, and `@ClassRule` extension points in
JUnit 4, the JUnit 5 extension model consists of a single, coherent concept: the
`TestExtension` API. Note, however, that `TestExtension` itself is just a marker
interface.

=== Registering Extensions

Developers can register one or more extensions by annotating a test class or test method
with `@ExtendWith(...)`, supplying class references for the extensions to register. For
example, to register a custom `MockitoExtension`, you would annotate your test class as
follows.

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim"]
----
@ExtendWith(MockitoExtension.class)
class MockTests {
	// ...
}
----

Multiple extensions can be registered together like this:

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim"]
----
@ExtendWith({ FooExtension.class, BarExtension.class })
class MyTestsV1 {
	// ...
}
----

As an alternative, multiple extensions can be registered separately like this:

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim"]
----
@ExtendWith(FooExtension.class)
@ExtendWith(BarExtension.class)
class MyTestsV2 {
	// ...
}
----

The execution of tests in both `MyTestsV1` and `MyTestsV2` will be extended by the
`FooExtension` and `BarExtension`, in exactly that order.

Registered extensions are inherited within test class hierarchies.


=== Conditional Test Execution

`{ContainerExecutionCondition}` and `{TestExecutionCondition}` define the `TestExtension`
APIs for programmatic, _conditional test execution_.

A `ContainerExecutionCondition` is _evaluated_ to determine if all tests in a given
container (e.g., a test class) should be executed based on the supplied
`ContainerExtensionContext`. Similarly, a `TestExecutionCondition` is _evaluated_ to
determine if a given test method should be executed based on the supplied
`TestExtensionContext`.

See the source code of `{DisabledCondition}` and `{Disabled}` for concrete examples.


=== Test Instance Post-processing

`{InstancePostProcessor}` defines the API for `TestExtensions` that wish to _post
process_ test instances.

Common use cases include injecting dependencies into the test instance, invoking custom
initialization methods on the test instance, etc.

For concrete examples, consult the source code for the `{MockitoExtension}` and the
`{SpringExtension}`.

=== Parameter Resolution

`{MethodParameterResolver}` is a `TestExtension` strategy for dynamically resolving
method parameters at runtime.

If a `@Test`, `@BeforeEach`, `@AfterEach` , `@BeforeAll` or `@AfterAll` method accepts a
parameter, the parameter must be _resolved_ at runtime by a `MethodParameterResolver`. A
`MethodParameterResolver` can either be built-in (see `{TestNameParameterResolver}`) or
registered by the user via `@ExtendWith`. Generally speaking, parameters may be resolved
by _type_ or by _annotation_. For concrete examples, consult the source code for
`{CustomTypeParameterResolver}` and `{CustomAnnotationParameterResolver}`, respectively.

=== Test Lifecycle Callbacks

The following interfaces define the APIs for extending tests at various points in the
test execution lifecycle. Consult the Javadoc for each of these in the
`{extension-api-package}` package.

* `BeforeEachExtensionPoint`
* `AfterEachExtensionPoint`
* `BeforeAllExtensionPoint`
* `AfterAllExtensionPoint`

Note that extension developers may choose to implement any number of these interfaces
within a single extension. Consult the source code of the `{SpringExtension}` for a
concrete example.


=== Extension Point Application Order

Sometimes you want to influence the order in which several extensions of the same type are applied.
This goal can be achieved by implementing the `{ExtensionRegistrar}` interface...


=== Keeping State in Extensions

Usually, an extension is instantiated only once. So the question becomes relevant: How do you keep the state
from one invocation of an extension point to the next? ...



=== Additional Planned Extension Points

Several additional extension points are planned, including but not
limited to the following.

* Dynamic test registration â€“ for example, for computing parameterized tests at runtime
