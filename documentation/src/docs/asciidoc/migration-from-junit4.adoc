== Migrating from JUnit 4

Although the JUnit 5 programming model and extension model will not support JUnit 4
features such as `Rules` and `Runners`, it is not expected that source code maintainers
will need to update all of their existing tests, test extensions, and custom build test
infrastructure to migrate to JUnit 5.

Instead, JUnit 5 provides a gentle migration path via a _JUnit 4 test engine_ which
allows existing tests based on JUnit 4 to be executed using the JUnit 5 infrastructure.
Since all classes and annotations specific to JUnit 5 reside under a new `org.junit.gen5`
base package, having both JUnit 4 and JUnit 5 in the classpath does not lead to any
conflicts. It is therefore safe to maintain existing JUnit 4 tests alongside JUnit 5
tests. Furthermore, since the JUnit team will continue to provide maintenance and bug fix
releases for the JUnit 4.x baseline, developers have plenty of time to migrate to JUnit 5
on their own schedule.

=== Running JUnit 4 Tests with JUnit 5

Just make sure that the `junit4-engine` artifact is in your test runtime path. In that
case JUnit 4 tests will automatically be picked up by JUnit 5 test runners.

See the example projects in the
https://github.com/junit-team/junit5-samples[junit5-samples] repository to find out how
this is done with Gradle and Maven.

=== Migration Tips

The following are things you have to watch out for when migrating existing JUnit 4 tests
to JUnit 5.

* Annotations reside in the `org.junit.gen5.api` package.
* Assertions reside in `org.junit.gen5.api.Assertions`.
* Assumptions reside in `org.junit.gen5.api.Assumptions`.
* `@Before` and `@After` no longer exist; use `@BeforeEach` and `@AfterEach` instead.
* `@BeforeClass` and `@AfterClass` no longer exist; use `@BeforeAll` and `@AfterAll` instead.
* `@Ignore` no longer exists: use `@Disabled` instead.
* `@Category` no longer exists; use `@Tag` instead.
* `@RunWith` no longer exists; superseded by `@ExtendWith`.
* `@Rule` and `@ClassRule` no longer exist; superseded by `@ExtendWith`.
